# Repository Creation
In this part we will talk about the creation of the repository that we will be using in this case is the Exprees repository, which we will see below. 

## Methods
First we'll talk about what Express 
is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application infrastructure that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
This is also in part to performance that provides us with a thin layer of basic web application features, which do not hide the Node.js features.
in an easier way to describe Express Js
Express can be defined as a flexible (*no opinion*) web application framework written in JavaScript that runs in a Node environment.
For which we will do the following commands to be able to install it in a better way
1 we will use the first line to generate the folders and repositories that we are going to use npx express-generator *project name -v hbs* this command will generate 4 folders and two files one in js and the other in json.
2 We will proceed to make the installation of the dependencies which will use for its operation this command we will do it from the terminal with the npmi 
3 then we will proceed to install the modules that the application requires for its operation this we will do it with the npm i node_modules command. 
4 once we have all the folders we can start the program with the npm star never forgetting that everything is done from the terminal. 

## Results
one of the results we can reach is how we can make one of the express installations and how we can visualize the code in such a way that it can work for us to know how is the development of the applications.
