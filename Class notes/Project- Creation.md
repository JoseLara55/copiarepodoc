The first part for the creation of our repository in github is to create a new account. 
+Once the account is created in Githhub we will proceed to go to the repository section where we +will make the configurations to be able to make use of it. 
+Once in the repository section what we will do is to configure it.
+the first step is to choose the name of our repository which will be: projnotes-2023a-class

+we will proceed to activate the README file part so that we can make annotations in case it is required 
+we will choose the type of license that we are going to use or that we believe that it is more convenient to have.
+With all the configurations of the repository we can create it and make use of it.
